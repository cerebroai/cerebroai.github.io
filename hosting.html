                <h1>The Guide to hosting your services on StreackIt</h1>
                <p style="margin-top:3em">StreackIt provides students an opportunity to deploy their products on our cloud services
                without the hassle of worrying about finding a domain, a server which is fast enough. Given that our systems are not yet 
                as sophisticated as existing ones, people who wish to deploy their services must manage code submitting either through 
                an online repository.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <p>
                    <li>Ensure a dependencies file for your project, when we deploy your service the server will create a virtual 
                        environment for your project and add dependencies to your environment only
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Additional scripts which need to be run can be placed in a run.sh file (no other file will be run) to do additional 
                        computations. This file must be present in the main directory
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Before we can deploy your service, we would need to make sure you are a student and have logged in at least once
                        into StreakIt. (We currently function with IIT Gandhinagar)
                    </li>
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Domain</h3>
                <p>
                    Users will be given the option of choosing their subdomain name (terms and conditions apply), however otherwise your service will be assigned to 
                    <b>{submdomain}.streackit.com</b>. 
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Starting your application</h3>
