                        Monetizing however on the other hand will be mostly based on the number of likes, comments, posts. Monetization will also 
                        be subjected to restrictions on the subspace to wish you post. This means subspaces, which tend to be discussion based are treatly different.
                        However this does not mean that such content won't be monetized. It simply means such content will ne treatly differently compared to
