                <h1>The Guide to hosting your portfolio/personal website on StreackIt</h1>
                <p style="margin-top:3em">StreackIt provides students an opportunity to deploy their personal websites/portfolios on our cloud services
                without the hassle of worrying about finding a domain, a server which is fast enough. Given that our systems are not yet 
                as sophisticated as existing ones, people who wish to deploy their services must manage code submitting either through 
                an online repository.</p>
                <p>Please note that we only supoort static websites through this service and if you wish to have a dynamic project, you may 
                    consider our other option of hosting your projects
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <p>
                    <li>Ensure a dependencies file for your project, when we deploy your service the server will create a virtual 
                        environment for your project and add dependencies to your environment only or
                    </li>
                    <li>You are welcome to submit your codebases via email if you are uncomfortable with github. Please note that your landing page
                        will be served from the index.html file of your code base
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Before we can deploy your service, we would need to make sure you are a student and have logged in at least once
                        into StreakIt. (We currently function with IIT Gandhinagar)
                    </li>
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Domain</h3>
                <p>
                    Users will be given the option of choosing their subdomain name (terms and conditions apply), however otherwise your service will be assigned to 
                    <b>{iitgn username}.streackit.com</b>. 
                </p>
                <br><br>
